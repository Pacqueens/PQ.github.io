        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Pacqueens Irabor, The Lovepreneur.
		</p> 
        <p> 
My life's purpose is to make heaven out of earth in every community through the passionate works of LOVEPRENEURS-PURPOSEful and LOVEfilled Leaders. Lovepreneurs are Fulfilled Leaders. Their lives are filled with LOVE. They are dedicated to giving and forgiving. Lovepreneurs possesses nothing neither are they possed by anything, yet they are the conduit of everything. Lovepreneurs are FULL and FILLED with everything they connect to and distribute freely. Lovepreneurs understand how to connect to the Love of heaven in order to create Heaven on Earth by distributing and filling the earth with LOVE(Light, Order, Value & Everlasting Life). 
		</p> 
        <p> 
A PURPOSEful life is a LOVEfilled Life. A PURPOSEless life is a CORRUPTIONfilled Life. Corruption (disconnection from purpose) is the mother of DARKNESS, DISORDERLINESS AND EMPTINESS, the three age long problems, limitations and frustrations that consistently plaque the earth and all that is in the earth </p>       
        <p> My major tool and resource is the WORD and POWER of LOVEPRENEURSHIP. I propagate this message everywhere and with everyone to give people an eternal life transforming encounter with their god-word (their personal and unique life's purpose) and to transform them to live as gods on earth. 
        </p>
        <p> 
I believe people's life purposes, are their unique expression of their creator, their source, their saviour and their God. Your life's purpose can never be discovered in your body nor your spirit but in the spirit of your Source or God. So you can connect with it with your spirit. You must engage your spirit in a search from within to without. When people search with love (compassionately and passionately) the world around them they will find God everywhere and encounter their god-word. Your god-word is always connected to the problems of others around you. Your purpose is the your unique expression of your God on earth. Your purpose is your message of Christ to save the world from perishing the result of man's corruption. When you encounter and believe your purpose, it stays with you as an eternal burden. When you understand your purpose enough and release your power of free will to believe it, it becomes a supernatural force that changes your NATURE, your CULTURE and your FUTURE (making your world heaven on earth). This is the way that ordinary people on earth connect with the power of LOVE in Heaven to create HEAVEN out of their EARTH in every community and to escape the darkness, disorderliness and emptiness caused by CORRUPTION. The actions of purposeful men in the flesh in line with the passions in their hearts, that were generated by purpose, is what transform earth to heaven and create days full of PLEASURE without PRESSURES and years filled with TREASURES without MEASURE for every life. 
       </p>
       <p> 
The message of LOVEPRENEURSHIP empowers citizens of every nation to overcome corruptions at all levels (personal, family, business, industry and government) fostering personal fulfillment and national development.  
       </p>
       <p>
With a background in development finance and 2 decades of passionate work in the development space, I am dedicated to helping individuals, families, business, industry and government leaders to discover, develop and deploy their god-word and create heaven out of earths everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
As a thought leader in Lovepreneurship, I aim to inspire others to discover their life purposes and maximise their unique gifts, talents and endowments to bring about their personal fulfilment, the betterment of their living environments and the advancement of the government of heaven on earth. Join me on this journey towards making the world a better place, starting with your personal transformation. </p>
